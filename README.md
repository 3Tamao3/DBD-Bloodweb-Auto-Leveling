# DBD-auto-leveling(Bloodweb)

Info
-
Dead By Daylight Bloodweb leveling script. The script clicks for you.

You need to be atleast prestige 1 to unlock the automatic purchase bloodweb feature.

you need to change ur settings to this: https://prnt.sc/Dd5-AV0zLaUq.

After everything is done just open the Bloodweb and press F7 to start the script. If you want to stop the script just press F7 again.

The script works only on 1920x1080 res. cuz of the fixed coordinates

(It is not bannable because Dead By Daylight doesn't care if you use macros or something like that so don't worry c:)
